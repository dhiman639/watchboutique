Inspired by a love of flying historic aircraft, of watches and all things mechanical, our timepieces had to be tested beyond the normal call of duty. The business has made a considerable investment into its in-house manufacturing over the years and in 2021 moved into its state-of-the-art “Manufacturing & Technology Centre”. All watches in our core range are either COSC or ISO chronometer rated and all our watches are built with considerable care here in the UK. Our watches are immensely precise, reliable and durable, Bremont watches are hand built in limited numbers.<\/p><p>Each is designed to appeal to those who share our passion for, and appreciation of, the innovation and mastery behind a beautiful mechanical wristwatch.

Nick was practicing for an air display with their father Euan. But the 1942 WWII Harvard aircraft they were flying was involved in an accident. Giles, waiting to take off for the next sortie was told that his father had been killed. His brother had broken over 30 bones and probably wouldn't make it.<br\/><br\/>Six months later, however, Nick was back in the air and being flown by Giles. But things would never be the same again. Life was too short to waste. The two brothers decided to pursue what they enjoyed most: a life crafting beautifully engineered mechanical devices.<br\/><br\/>When they weren't flying old aircraft, Nick & Giles had spent most of their childhood making and restoring things in the workshop of their gifted father - an ex-RAF pilot with a PHD in Aeronautical Engineering. They even helped him to build an aircraft they still fly to this day. Euan was also passionate about mechanical timepieces. He would often bring home an old clock from an auction for the brothers to try and get going again.
